          <p>Hey everyone, it’s me, Angus Walker, GM of the Loose Gooses and CEO of the LTBO, here with the second ‘Crunching Numbers’! This article is looking into the finals, how each team performed, and what each team needs to do to
            give themselves the best chance at winning the chip. I'm going to try to make this one a little shorter, so get reading!

            <h3 >Finals Week: The Story of Each Team</h3>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p>The first two rounds of the finals just finished, meaning that we’re left with just one more monster day – the Grand Finale. While the date is still being decided, the 90 minute session is going to be packed with highlights, tough buckets, 
                and defensive efforts. I already know the tensions and beef between teams are going to be CRAZY high, already this week it’s been wild. The finals have been incredibly exciting, at least for two of the teams. The <strong>5 Musketeers</strong> and <strong>Wet Willies</strong> 
                traded wins, having near identical records (the 5 Musketeers had one more win and one less loss over the four days). The <strong>Loose Gooses</strong> however were no where to be seen, getting just four wins over the two days. Anyways, here’s the breakdown for each team:</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Wet Willies:</strong> Over the course of the tournament, it’s been hard to find any faults with the Wet Willies. They’ve dominated for the majority of the tournament, and if it wasn’t for a sloppy week or two, they’d be way ahead of the competition. With <strong>GM Rudy Hoschke</strong> returning after injury, the Wet 
                Willies have been at full power, winning 60% of their games. They came away with second and first, placing at first place on the ladder, 3 points ahead of second. While you could put the success to <strong>Alexander Galt</strong> and Rudy Hoschke, their scoring has come from different players entirely. 
                While Alex and Rudy have combined for an extra 2.8 points per game during the finals, <strong>Nicholas Szogi</strong> (who has the highest increase during the finals at 4.9 ppg) and <strong>Clarrie Jones</strong> have been the leading scorers, combining for an extra <em>8.8</em> points per game. They’ve combined for 
                60% of their teams points, making a huge impact as third and fourth man. Clarrie has hit a whopping 4 threes, and Nick has 3. With each game being a best-of-3, the three point shot makes a huge difference, as it means an automatic win. While they’ve been doing the scoring, the 
                success has been a huge team effort, each player contributing in their own ways. <strong>Ryan Pattemore</strong> has continued his lock down defence (after winning the perimeter defender award), and <strong>Willie Weekes</strong> (winner of the teammate award) always has his teams back, cheering them up after a loss 
                or celebrating with them after a win, as well as getting some steals and rebounds.
